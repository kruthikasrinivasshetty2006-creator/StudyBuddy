- **Orchestrator Agent** — Coordinates all agents and validates outputs  
- **Task Breakdown Agent** — Splits tasks into subtasks with priority  
- **Study Schedule Agent** — Generates time-based study plans  
- **Resource Fetcher Agent** — Collects reference materials automatically  
- **Progress Analyzer Agent** — Tracks completed vs. pending work  
- **Session Memory + Memory Bank** — Personalizes planning based on learning history
